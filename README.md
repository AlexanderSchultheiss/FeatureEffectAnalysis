# FeatureEffectAnalysis
Analyzer plug-in to calculate feature effect constraints, as proposed by [Nadi, Berger, KÃ¤stner, and Czarnecki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/pdf/tse15.pdf)

## Provides
* Detects presence condtions for variables (expressions for variable code parts): `de.uni_hildesheim.sse.kernel_haven.feature_effects.PcFinder`
* Calculation of feature effect constraints based on detected presence conditions: `de.uni_hildesheim.sse.kernel_haven.feature_effects.FeatureEffectFinder`
